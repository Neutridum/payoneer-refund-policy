# Payoneer Refund Policy

    I undertake all projects under the purview of Milestones that dictate the direction / road-map followed by the project.
    All Development/ Applications are carried out and accepted upon a complete analysis and creation of a complete scope document, in order to make sure that we (I and client) have complete understanding of the work needed to be done, elimination possibilities of a project cancellation / reversal / dispute
    Since I understand that there is work involved in achieving every milestone of the project and completion of every module, a refund would not be possible for the work already completed.
    I make sure that in case of a project termination on a mutual basis, the client has control of all the work done till that date and the money, if paid for further development, is returned.
    I also respects a decision made by a client to works with a different provider within 48 hours of the project initiation. In such a scenario I would refund the amount for the project that has been paid till date.
    No cancellations are entertained for those Services. These are limited occasion offers and therefore cancellations are not possible.
